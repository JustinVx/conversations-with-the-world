I created this small project while working on the blogger tutorial by Jumpstart Lab, one of my first encounters with Ruby on Rails. It is part of Webdevelopment 101 course on the Odin Project I am currently following.

GOAL:
Make a web-app that can function as a messaging platform for two (or more) people.

I used Rails 5.0.0.1 with ruby 2.3.0p0
